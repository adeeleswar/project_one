## OpenNESS Network Functions
This folder contains Network functions that are critical for edge deployment from 4G, 5G, Wireline and IP. They include RAN, Core etc. depending on the deployment.

> Note: Not all network functions will be provided as source or runtime format by OpenNESS. The intention is to provide customer the basic deployment specification (dockerfile, pod specification, libvirt xml, etc..) on how a given 4G, 5G, Wireline or IP deployment were validated by the OpenNESS. Network functions may be Container network function CNF or Virtual machine based VNF.
